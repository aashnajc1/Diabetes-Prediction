# Diabetes-Prediction

Given a dataset which contains information that is required to tell whether a patient has diabetes or not. Using the given information a prediction model was created to predict whether the particular patient has diabetes or not.

The features of the dataset are : Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, BMI, DiabetesPedigreeFunction and Age.

This model was made using two algorithms:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Support Vector Machine 

The model was evaluated using two metrics:
1)Accuracy score 
2)F1 score

The accuracy score and the F1 score of both the algorithms is compared.
